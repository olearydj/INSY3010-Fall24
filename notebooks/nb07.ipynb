    "## Best Practices with Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "It may not yet be clear why it is worth the trouble to divide a program into\n",
    "functions. When you begin solving more complex problems, and writing longer code to do so, the benefits will become obvious: \n",
    "\n",
    "-   Creating a new function gives you an opportunity to name a group of statements, which makes your program easier to read and debug.\n",
    "-   Functions can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code. Later, if you make a change, you only have to make it in one place.\n",
    "-   Dividing a long program into functions allows you to debug the parts one at a time and then assemble them into a working whole\n",
    "-   Well-designed functions are often useful for many programs. Once you write and debug one, you can reuse it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Until then, get in the habit of using functions whenever you find yourself repeating code more than twice. Stop and extract that code into one or more short functions that are each designed to perform a single, well-defined task. Use parameters to make the functions flexible, and improve the code readability by naming everything effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following those recommendations will go a long way towards improving the readability, maintainability, and efficiency of your code. It will also teach you to solve problems through functional decomposition - breaking big problems down into smaller ones, and building solutions from the resulting components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adopting these practices will significantly enhance your code's readability, maintainability, and efficiency. More importantly, it will cultivate your *functional decomposition* skills. This powerful problem-solving approach involves breaking complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts, from which comprehensive solutions are constructed. Through consistent use of this approach you'll find it is an invaluable tool for tackling increasingly sophisticated programming challenges."
