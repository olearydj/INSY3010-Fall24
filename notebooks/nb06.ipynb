    "\n",
    "More formally, here is the flow of execution for a while statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaluate the condition, yielding `True` or `False`.\n",
    "- If the condition is `False`, exit the `while` statement and continue execution at the next statement.\n",
    "- If the condition is `True`, execute the associated code block (aka body) and then go back to step 1.\n",

    "\n",
    "**The body of the loop should change the value of one or more variables so that eventually the condition becomes false and the loop terminates.** We call the variable that changes each time the loop executes and controls when the loop finishes the iteration variable.

    "\n",
    "The *keyword parameter* `end` allows you to specify what string is included at the end of a `print` output.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is like the `sep` parameter we discussed earlier, which overrides the string normally used between the comma separated expressions in a `print` statement. By default, the separation string is a single space (`' '`), but you can change that by using `sep='<desired separation string>'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the default end string is the *newline character*, `\\n`. When printed, the newline character moves the cursor to the beginning of the next line without any other visible effect. Therefore, by default, any `print`ed output in Python ends with a newline character and subsequent `print` output will start at the beginning of the next line.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, we've overriden that behavior by specifying `end=' '`. As a result, each print output starts one space after the last finished so that all outputs are on the same line.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can always get a reminder of these details with `help(print)`, the output of which includes the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Help on built-in function print in module builtins:\n",
    "\n",
    "print(*args, sep=' ', end='\\n', file=None, flush=False)\n",
    "    Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "    sep\n",
    "      string inserted between values, default a space.\n",
    "    end\n",
    "      string appended after the last value, default a newline.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Whitespace and Escape Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "The newline character is an example of an *escape sequence*. In Python these coded strings begin with a backslash (`\\`). Escape sequences are used to represent special characters or to produce special effects in strings. They allow you to include characters that would be difficult or impossible to type directly, or to represent non-printing characters with visible symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "Characters like space and newline, which move the cursor by adding space to the output are called *whitespace* characters. Python supports several other whitespace characters, the most common of which is the tab (`\\t`) character, which moves the cursor to the next tab stop column (typically every 8 spaces). This is useful for simple left-justified text alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use whitespace characters in any string. The space character is an obvious example of this, but the same goes for newlines and tabs. Simply include `\\n` where you would like to start a new line or `\\t` wherever you would like to jump to the next tab stop. Alternatively, an empty print statement (`print()`) can also be used to add blank lines to Python output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code demonstrates all of these concepts. Run it and compare the code with the output to ensure you understand how newline and tab escape sequences can be used to format your output in Python."

    "## Best Practices with Loops\n",

    "This notebook has provided a variety of examples that use different looping methods to achieve similar results. Many beginners will be left wondering how to choose the \"right\" method. With time and experience you gain intuition in this regard. Meanwhile, let's boil it down to some concrete recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `for` to directly iterate over the contents of a sequence (e.g. string or list) or other iterable object types whenever possible.\n",
    "- Prefer `for ... in range()` when doing a known number of iterations or when looping over a known set of integer values.\n",
    "- Use `while` when the number of iterations is unknown / indefinite or you have to loop \"until something happens.\" While it is true that `while` can do anything `for` can, `for` does many things better than `while`.\n",
    "- Use `break` and/or `continue` sparingly and purposefully to simplify the logic and/or improve the readability of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all of these recommendations have been followed by the examples provided herein. This was done to illustrate the variety\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've seen above, when using a loop to modify list elements in-place, the added complexity of an index-based approach is required. Except in that case, and others like it, avoid using `for` or `while` to loop through sequences by index number. For example, instead of this:"

    "\n",
    "One way to cut your debugging time is “debugging by bisection.” For example, if there are 100 lines in your program and you check them one at a time, it would take 100 steps.\n",

    "\n",
    "In practice it is not always clear what the “middle of the program” is and not always possible to check it. It doesn’t make sense to count lines and find the exact midpoint. Instead, think about places in the program where there might be errors and places where it is easy to put a check. Then choose a spot where you think the chances are about the same that the bug is before or after the check."
